👋 Hi, I’m @NotSage, a 23 years old Rengma nerd interested in Full stack web development(present).

Completed my Bachelor of Computer Applications degree @ICFAI University Nagaland, India (Batch 2018-2021).

The thing which intrigues me as of now is javascript on webpages, because you can do a whole lot of things with that object-oriented language.
The end goal for me on this short journey is making good e-commerce/informative/blogs/vlogs, Well Designed and Functional, Easy to Use, Quality content dynamic websites for the public.

Languages I'm familiar with-
*c
*c++
*java
*javascipt

Languages I'm yet to learn-
*Python(Flask)
*php (mysql db)
*nodejs (express,mangodb,jquery)
*

👀 I’m currently freelancing on making web projects.
